# MetaLab

**MetaLab** is an open-source Python/C++ programming package for the inverse design of nanoscale optics devices by machine learning methods. By using powerful machine learning algorithms (deep neural network, [GBDT](https://github.com/closest-git/LiteMORT) ...),  MetaLab supports quick design of optical structures with high accuracy. The latest version could be accessed and downloaded from https://github.com/closest-git/MetaLab.

### Work with us

 Weâ€™re especially interested in hearing from and potentially working with those who are studying
- Inverse design of nanophotonic devices by machine learning methods
- Novel machine learning methods for inverse problems
